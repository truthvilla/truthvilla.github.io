                <p> Hi, I'm Lewis. I have a degree in Computer Science from National Open University, Nigeria. I am a creative web developer just coming up and i have the aim to surprise the with my ideas and innovations also to help several brands and industries to reinvent themselves by offering them my expertise.
                I am here to connect with like minds to innovate, create and achieve our dreams through exclusive learning of new skills so that we can grow both personally and professionally.

             "Do what you can't." 
             - Casey Neistat.

               I have a passion for anything related to the digital world. I started having this passion at the age of 16 and since then I have immersed myself in the study of computers, programming, the Internet, and Internet culture.
                </p>
                <p> I always believe that it's not enough to just live in the world as it is and take what ever is given to you or what people tell you to do. The best way to be innovative is to be always questioning and creating.

               My main goal is to connect with people, the more and more people I connect with the more excited I am.   </p>
